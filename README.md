# AI_Traffic-Control-System

Introduction

The AI-TLC (Artificial Intelligence Traffic Light Control) system is designed to optimize urban traffic management by leveraging real-time data analysis and dynamic signal adjustments within the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) environment. This system integrates AI models, including a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for traffic prediction and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time vehicle detection, to effectively manage traffic flows at intersections.

This README will guide you through the setup, configuration, and usage of the AI-TLC software, including how to run simulations within SUMO.

Prerequisites

Before running the AI-TLC system, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

Python 3.7+

SUMO-gui
https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php



Step

1, Install requirement.txt

2, Run python Main_system\AI_TLC.py

3, Enter environment parameter value on software UI, .cfg are included in Main_system\2024-08-19-21-37-59

4, Press start and enjoy

Remark: If you want to exit simulation, then please press Q button on the keybroad
